		<H3>Startup with the API</H3>

		<p>With a lot of the different options we will be working with the Web API. This will allow you to get album data, playlists and other content that only a spotify user can get. Speaking of that, you need to be a spotify user to use the API, which isn’t a big deal considering you don’t pay any money. </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Signing up:</h3>

        <p>It is a very simple setup and since I am currently a spotify user, but if you are not, take a couple of moments and sign up for their services, if for nothing else than to just try their api. </p>
        <br>

		<p>To sign up, go to <a href="http://www.spotify.com" target = "_blank"> Spotify. </a></p>
        <p>Once you have signed up for spotify, navigate to the developer link (linked below) and accept the developer terms of use. </p>

        <p>Immediately, doing this, you will need to go to the actual api website, this is where you get the option to check out not only the web API, which is what we will be working on, but other APIs, SDKs, and widgets. </p>

        <p>The link to that website is <a href="https://developer.spotify.com" target = "_blank"> here. </a>
        </p>
