		<h3> Sass Vs Less </h3>

		<p> There are a couple of things that seperate Less and Sass. Finding out the better or worse of the two is like asking what the best fruit is. Its essentially like asking the age old: Emacs vs. Vim, Mac vs. Windows, etc. There is no clear winner. Each of these technologies have their pros and cons. Sass is a little more hardcore than Less in the sense that there's more you can do with it.  However, on the other hand, Sass is ran on Ruby which is beyond difficult to set up on windows, as it isn't on windows naturally. Less is created with JavaScript so when you download it initially, that's the setup. Both services are ran in the command line for the most part. However there are several <a href ="https://graygrids.com/best-tools-resources-compile-manage-sass-less-stylus-css-preprocessors/">GUIs</a> available for people to use. This is useful if the command line is not something you like to work with. Less is missing a fantastic framework called <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>   </p>

		<p> If you look at Google trends for Sass and Less, you will see that Sass continues to rise and rise while Less hit a peak and has fallen ever so slightly.</p>
