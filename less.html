		<H3>What is Less?</H3>

		<p>First off... what is Less? The official documentation is linked on the first page but a breif overview of less is... Less was created in 2009 by Alexis Sellier, more commonly known as cloudhead. Originally written in Ruby, it was then ported to JavaScript.</p>
		<p> In May 2012 Alexis relinquished control and development over to a core team of contributors who now manage, fix and extend the language. </p>
		<br>
		<p> Less is an open source technology, which makes me happy to talk about it, as open source is always in need of more people talking about it. Sass came before Less, and Less is formatted in the same CSS formatting as Sass, and is scripted in a nested similarity.</p>
        <br>
		<p>Less has the advantage of using things like functions and variables to do what basic.. normal CSS cannot do. It is dynamically typed, cross platform and yet another front end technology. Though, in complete contast with the language it was created with, it is not a saturated market place. There are tons of javascript frameworks, though the two CSS frameworks of note are SASS and LESS.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The exciting things that less allow you to use are: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Variables</li>
				<li>Functions</li>
				<li>Mixins</li>
				<li>Operators</li>
				<li>Nesting</li>
			</ol>

		<p> Mixins are really cool, the gist of the functionality is it will allow the embedding of all the properties of a class into another class, simply by including the class name as one of the properties.</p>

		<p> The functionality of Less is impressive to say the least, the code examples I have given here today show its functionality, however, Sass has the scope of use in the web development world. </p>
		<br>
		
		
        <p> As it stands on Github currently Less has: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>732 Watchers </li>
			<li>14,751 Stars </li>
			<li>3,392 Forks</li>
		</ol>

		<p> Less' pros are: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Quick install</li>
			<li>JavaScript implementation</li>
			<li>It's easy to learn (relatively speaking)</li>
		</ol>
