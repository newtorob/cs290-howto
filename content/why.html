		<H3>What is an API?</H3>

		<p>I wanted to use the spotify API because Spotify is something I use everyday. Whether I am driving to work, listening to spotify while I code at work or going to the gym, Spotify is my GO-TO application for everything in life. They are one of the leading music streaming companies, boasting upwards of 50 million monthly subscribers. </p>
        <br>

        <p>They allow offline listening, as well as High Quality and High Fidelity listening. They are on all major platforms, and work in sync with all major platforms. There are family options, and integrations such as Sonos, a speaker company, Amazon Echo and others. That is what I will be looking at in this project. How to integrate Spotifyâ€™s API into your everyday web app. </p>
