        <p>Once you have signed up for spotify, navigate to the developer link (linked below) and accept the developer terms of use. </p>

        <p>Immediately, doing this, you will need to go to the actual api website, this is where you get the option to check out not only the web API, which is what we will be working on, but other APIs, SDKs, and widgets. </p>

        <p>The link to that website <a href ="https://developer.spotify.com"> here.</a></p>

        <h3>Registering Your App:</h3>

        <p>After visiting the developer website, you will need to register your app. This is only if you need to access a user’s personal data.</p> 

        <p>For this example, I have created a small program called CS290 App and registered it with my information for this class. </p>
            
        <p>It is seriously just as easy as clicking the button and following the instructions. </p>

        <a href="http://imgur.com/rdR1Ltb"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rdR1Ltb.png" title="source: imgur.com" width = '30%' /></a>
        <br>

        <p>You will be able to set the name, and description of the app. Then you can link it to your website where a user could learn more about your individual application. This is where you will also get the client ID and the client secret. 
            
        <p>It is very important that you store these securely, for the purpose of this app, we will use the  client ID of:</p>
        <br>
            <p>6ecd28cae7dd4de28d688c8a43f41875. </p>

        <p>This is also where you will set the URIs, Bundle IDs and Android packages. One of the best features is the statistics page as well.</p>

        <p>To access basic levels of info, you needn’t ask for permission, but if you want to access a personal account or playlist you need authorization. </p>
            
            
        <p>Spotify uses the Authorization Code Flow, which essentially provides an access token after the user has logged in once, and allows that token to be refreshed.  </p>

        <p>A normal request will need to use GET, and you will need a couple of parameters like client_id, response_type, and redirect_uri. There are a couple of parameter that are mentions on the site that are optional but provide extra assurances that your connection was made. </p>
            
        <p>An example of a normal statement would look like this:</p>
        <br>
        <script async src="//jsfiddle.net/newtorob/hey5m783/embed/js,html,css,result/dark/" width = '30%'></script>
        <br>


        <p>When the user accepts or denies your request, redirect_uri brings them back: </p>
            <br>
            https://example.com/callback?code=NApCCg..BkWtQ&state=profile%2Factivity
        <br>

        <p> Using POST request for Spotify Accounts services, the authorization has been completed, the access token needs to be exchanged with it:</p>
        <br>
        POST https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
        <br>


        <p>For the POST request, you have three parameters that are REQUIRED: grant_type for the OAuth 2.0 specification for the authorization_code value. The other two parameters are code and redirect_uri.</p>

        <p>Say if I wanted to get an album, any album,all I would need to do is a simple GET request, for that, you also need the URI of the album to do so:</p>
        <a href="http://imgur.com/7RImHa1"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7RImHa1.png" title="source: imgur.com" width='30%'/></a>

        <p>  GET http://ws.spotify.com/lookup/1/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A6G9fHYDCoyEErUkHrFYfs4 </p>

        <p>The same would go for an artist or song, all you need is the URI of what you are searching.</p>

        <p>This of course makes it extremely easy to find the songs, albums and artists you are requesting from Spotify. Which of course makes using the API a way better experience.</p>

        
        <h3>Going Forward:</h3>

        <p>Once you have gotten your Client ID and secret key located on the test app page, you will need to prepare the environment you plan to use the API in.</p> 
        
        <p>One of the main things you need, if you don’t already have it is node. </p>

        <p>You can get it <a href = "https://nodejs.org/en/"> here </a> </p>
        

        <p>Most of what you do with the API will be server-side for the most part.</p>

        <p>To check that node was installed correctly, open your terminal and type:</p>

        <p>node -v</p>

        <p>From there you are able to create and build anything with the help of the API.</p>
