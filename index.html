		<p>For this assignment, I looked at SASS and LESS, the differences and the comparisons, I chose this because I work with front end technologies and both of these CSS preprocessors have always interested me. We have looked moving to other technologies for our projects but we haven't made the move yet. This will be my first foret into learning about these preprocessors in great detail. </p>

		<p> What are preprocessors? What is the good and the bad of them? Why use them at all? Preprocessors, the likes of Sass and Less, convert into CSS that web browsers can read. The commmon expression is to call Sass and Less supercharged CSS because they are basically extensions of normal everyday CSS. The extensions they make though, include things like variables, funcitons, mixins,  and more. We will explain mixins later. When it boils down to it, CSS as it stands currently is awful to work with, it is the cause of many hours of frustration. Less, Sass and other preprocessors aim to remedy this pain. These like other technologies, exist to make your life easier, your workflow faster and make you a more efficient programmer overall. </p>
