		<H3>What is an API?</H3>

		<p>API stands for application programming interfaces. Essentially it’s an external library that web developers can use to add some functionality to their web app. API’s also have the ability to be used on operating, database systems, and of course hardware. Essentially in normal terms, it allows for two applications to speak to one another like normal people do. 
        </p>    
        <br>
        <p>It allows you to work with the existing code base without having to start from scratch. You use HTTP calls to “talk” to the API using a GET or POST form. Then using javascript, we can integrate Ajax to extract information easily. </p>
