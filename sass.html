		<H3>Sass</h3>
        <p>First off... what is Sass? The official documentation is linked on the first page but a breif overview of Sass is... a CSS framework that was initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum. After its initial versions, Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a simple scripting language used in Sass files. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Originally it was an indented syntax for css, which it currently still uses and it has another syntax known as SCSS, which is more block formatting like the original css. Ironic I know.</p>
        <p> Interesting enough though, the two main comparisons I am making in this guide are relatively similar. Considering Less, which I explain on another page, is based on Sass, but is not as heavy... hence less. Sass uses two files extensions: scss, and sass.Obviously it was influenced by CSS, but CSS wasn't doing enough, hence the creation of Sass. Much like Less, it was created using Ruby, it is open source, and it has other implementations. But instead of it being in javascript, it has implementations in php (blegh), C and surprisingly, Java (known as JSass).</p> 

        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/4bHV7w9.png" title="source: imgur.com" />

        <p>Sass has a lot of the same implementations as less (rather less has a lot of the same implementations as Sass):
            <ol>
                <li>variables</li>
                <li>nesting</li>
                <li>mixins</li>
            </ol>

            <p> One thing that is different though, and in my opinion is the major standout among the two technologies is <strong>selector inheritance</strong>.</p>

            <br>
            <p> In regards to sass and the variables, simple enough, it has the ability to use things like normal variables, numbers, strings and booleans. But it can also use colors, which is more or less a CSS thing. Nesting is again a large part of this and why I like both of these technologies so much, however, the blocks of code themeslves are not actually nested. The nested code can actually be inserted within each other. </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            Currently on Github, Sass has: </p>
            <ol>
                <li> 643 Watchers</li>
                <li> 9,864 Stars</li>
                <li> Has been forked 1801 times </li>
                </ol>

            <p> Overall, Sass is more advanced than Less, considering, Less is supposed to be a more stripped down version of Sass. </p>
